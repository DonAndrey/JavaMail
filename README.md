# JavaMail 

### Main Goal:
Make a desktop application that can send mails to a big group of people. 

### Description: 
This a desktop application use java as a programming language. It has a user interface that allows the user to: <br>
<ol>
  <li>Add a subject</li>
  <li>Write a message</li>
  <li>Add users to a specific group</li>
</ol>

Currently e-mails platforms like Gmail, Hotmail and so on, allows the function described before in a really easy way, but there are some platforms that are less commons and generally used by goverments institutions that could be harder to use, making the users to feel unconfortable, so this applications pretends to be a solution for that problem.
